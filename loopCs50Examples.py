# CREATING THE LOOP TO ASK THE USER TO INPUT N UNTIL THE USER ENTERS NUMBER GREATER THAN 0

# while True:
#     n = float(input("What's n? "))
#     if n > 0:
#         break

# for _ in range(int(n)):

# MAKING THE COMPLETE WORKING CODE OUT OF THE ABOVE CODE

    print(i + 1, students[i])


this is the changes that i want to do before stashing
